### Introduction and Corpus

**Introduction**

One of the biggest differences between jazz and classical music is that when you playing jazz, you have to improvise and compose on the spot and range things, however, with classical music, you are playing all the notes composed. A study even proved that there is a different process occurred in the brains of the jazz and classical pianists. In particular, the jazz pianists' brains began re-planning sooner than the classical pianists' brains. Classical pianists tend to focus on the 'how'. This means their focus is on technique and the personal expression they add to the piece. Jazz pianists on the other hand focus on the ‘what’ to play, meaning they are always prepared to improvise and adapt the notes they're playing. 

The output melody under 2 contrary mindses are different. Thus,this storyboard is going to analyzing the difference between jazz and classical music trying to illustrate what is the major difference between such freestyle and disciplined music.

**Corpus**

To completed the research focusing on the piano songs of both music genres, 2 Spotify playlist will be taken.
